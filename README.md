### Features

The seller creates a deal smart contract through the factory contract, and pledges the agreed number of tokens to the deal smart contract. After the buyer and the seller agree to complete the deal or cancel the deal, the pledged token will be returned to the accounts of both parties, otherwise the token will always be stored in the smart contract.


## Factory contract API

> Used to create a Deal contract

### Create Deal interface

| Param | desc |
| ---- | ---- |
| _personA  | Is the seller account address. |
| _personB  | Is the buyer's account address. |
| _dealToken  |  Is the contract address of the deal token, if the deal is not a token, you can pass address(0). |
| dealAmount  | Is the amount of the deal token, if the deal is not a token, you can pass 0. |
| _tokenA  | The contract address of the token pledged by the seller |
| _tokenB  | The contract address of the token pledged by the buyer |
| _tokenAAmount  |  The number of tokens pledged by the seller |
| _tokenBAmount  | The number of tokens pledged by the buyer |
| time  | Current timestamp |

```solidity
 function createDeal(address _personA, address _personB, address _dealToken, uint256 dealAmount, address _tokenA, address _tokenB, uint256 _tokenAAmount, uint256 _tokenBAmount, uint256 time) public returns (address businessDeal) 
```

### Get Deal interface

```solidity
 function getDeal(address _personA, address _personB, address _dealToken, uint256 dealAmount, address _tokenA, address _tokenB, uint256 _tokenAAmount, uint256 _tokenBAmount, uint256 time) public view override returns(address)
```

## BusinessDeal contract API

Called when the seller creates a contract through the factory, initializes a deal, and transfers the sellerâ€™s margin and deal token to the deal contract account at the same time

```solidity
function initialize(address _personA, address _personB, address _dealToken, uint256 _dealAmount, address _tokenA, address _tokenB, uint256 _tokenAAmount, uint256 _tokenBAmount, uint256 _time) public
```

Buyer pledges margin to Deal contract

```solidity
function deposit ()
```

The seller agrees to complete the deal

```solidity
function accept()
```

Cancel the deal. When the status is 1, the seller can unilaterally cancel it. When the status is 2, both the seller and the buyer need to call to cancel

```solidity
function cancel() 
```

Check the current status. When the seller creates the disease pledge deposit, the status is 1, and when the buyer pledges the deposit, the status is 2. When the deal is cancelled or completed, the status is 0.

```solidity
function currentState() return (uint256 status)
```
